Objectives
Familiarize the student with:

using the continue statement in loops;
modifying and upgrading the existing code;
reflecting real-life situations in computer code.
Scenario
Your task here is even more special than before: you must redesign the (ugly) vowel eater from the previous lab (3.1.2.10) and create a better, upgraded (pretty) vowel eater! Write a program that uses:

a for loop;
the concept of conditional execution (if-elif-else)
the continue statement.
Your program must:

ask the user to enter a word;
use user_word = user_word.upper() to convert the word entered by the user to upper case; we'll talk about the so-called string methods and the upper() method very soon - don't worry;
use conditional execution and the continue statement to "eat" the following vowels A, E, I, O, U from the inputted word;
assign the uneaten letters to the word_without_vowels variable and print the variable to the screen.
Look at the code in the editor. We've created word_without_vowels and assigned an empty string to it. Use concatenation operation to ask Python to combine selected letters into a longer string during subsequent loop turns, and assign it to the word_without_vowels variable.

Test your program with the data we've provided for you.


Test data
Sample input: Gregory

Expected output:

GRGRY
Sample input: abstemious

Expected output:

# solution 

user_word = input("Enter a word: ").upper()
word_without_vowels = ""

for letter in user_word:
    if letter in "AEIOU":
        continue
    word_without_vowels += letter

print(word_without_vowels)
