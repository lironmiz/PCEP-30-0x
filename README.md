# About The Certification 🗒️

PCEP™ – Certified Entry-Level Python Programmer certification shows that the individual is familiar with universal computer programming concepts like data types, containers, functions, conditions, loops, as well as Python programming language syntax, semantics, and the runtime environment.

PCEP™ – Certified Entry-Level Python Programmer certification (Exam PCEP-30-0x) is a professional credential that measures the candidate's ability to accomplish coding tasks related to the essentials of programming in the Python language. A test candidate should demonstrate sufficient knowledge of the universal concepts of computer programming, the syntax and semantics of the Python language, as well as the skills in resolving typical implementation challenges with the help of the Python Standard Library.

The PCEP™ certification shows that the individual is familiar with the following concepts: fundamental terms and definitions (e.g. compilation vs. interpretation), Python's logic and structure (e.g. keywords, instructions, indentation), literals, variables, and numeral systems, operators and data types, I/O operations, control flow mechanisms (conditional blocks and loops), data collections (lists, tuples, dictionaries, strings), functions (decomposition, built-in and user-defined functions, organizing interaction between functions and their environment, generators, recursion), exceptions (exception handling, hierarchies), as well as the essentials of Python programming language syntax, semantics, and the runtime environment.
